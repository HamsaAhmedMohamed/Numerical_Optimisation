# Numerical Optimisation -- Course Repository

This repository contains notes, assignments, implementations, and
experiments from the **Numerical Optimisation** course at the University
of Copenhagen.

## Course Information

-   **Course code:** NDAA09009U\
-   **Credits:** 7.5 ECTS\
-   **Level:** Master's\
-   **Block:** 3\
-   **Language:** English

## Course Overview

Numerical optimisation provides computational methods for solving
optimisation problems across domains such as machine learning,
scientific computing, computer vision, and physics.\
The course builds a **toolbox of optimisation algorithms** with strong
emphasis on both:

-   **Mathematical theory and derivations**
-   **Practical implementation and empirical evaluation**

Students gain a deep understanding of how optimisation methods work and
how to apply them to real computational problems.

## Topics Covered

Key theoretical and practical topics include:

-   Convex and non‑convex optimisation theory\
-   First‑order optimality conditions and KKT conditions\
-   Newton and quasi‑Newton methods\
-   Trust‑region methods\
-   Nonlinear equation solving and regression/least‑squares problems\
-   Implementation and testing of optimisation algorithms

## Learning Outcomes

### Knowledge

-   Theory of convex and non‑convex optimisation\

-   Optimality conditions for constrained optimisation

### Skills

-   Solving unconstrained and constrained minimisation problems\
